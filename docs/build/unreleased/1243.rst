    As Alembic 1.11.0 is considered a major release (Alembic does not use
    semver, nor does its parent project SQLAlchemy; this has been
    :ref:`clarified <versioning_scheme>` in the documentation), change
    :ticket:`1130` modified calling signatures for most operations to consider
    all optional keyword parameters to be keyword-only arguments, to match what
    was always documented and generated by autogenerate. However, two of these
    changes were identified as possibly problematic without a more formal
    deprecation warning being emitted which were the ``table_name`` parameter
    to :meth:`.Operations.drop_index`, which was generated positionally by
    autogenerate prior to version 0.6.3 released in 2014, and ``type_`` in
    :meth:`.Operations.drop_constraint` and
    :meth:`.BatchOperations.drop_constraint`, which was documented positionally
    in one example in the batch documentation.

    These two signatures have been
    restored to allow those particular parameters to be passed positionally. A
    future change will include formal deprecation paths (with warnings) for
    these arguments where they will again become keyword-only in a future
    "Significant Minor" release.

    Added ``encoding="locale"`` setting to the use of Python's
    ``ConfigParser.read()``, so that a warning is not generated when using the
    recently added Python feature ``PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING`` specified in
    :pep:`597`. The encoding is passed as the ``"locale"`` string under Python
    3.10 and greater, which indicates that the system-level locale should be
    used, as was the case already here.  Pull request courtesy Kevin Kirsche.

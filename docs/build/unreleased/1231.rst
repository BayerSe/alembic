    Added :meth:`.AbstractOperations.run_async` to the operation module to
    allow running async functions in the ``upgrade`` or ``downgrade`` migration
    function when running alembic using an async dialect. This function will
    receive as first argument an
    :class:`~sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio.AsyncConnection` sharing the transaction
    used in the migration context.

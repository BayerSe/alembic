    Added placeholder classes for ``Computed`` and ``Identity`` when older 1.x
    SQLAlchemy versions are in use, namely prior to SQLAlchemy 1.3.11 when the
    ``Computed`` construct was introduced. Previously these were set to None,
    however this could cause issues with certain codepaths that were using
    ``isinstance()`` such as one within "batch mode".

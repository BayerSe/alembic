    :tickets: 1325

    Improved typing in the
    :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.process_revision_directives`
    callable to better indicate that the passed-in type is
    :class:`.MigrationScript`, not the :class:`.MigrationOperation` base class,
    and added typing to the example at :ref:`cookbook_no_empty_migrations` to
    illustrate.

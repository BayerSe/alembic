    :tags: bug, autogenerate
    :tickets: 1145

    Fixed issue where server default compare would not work for string defaults
    that contained backslashes, due to mis-rendering of these values when
    comparing their contents.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, oracle

    Implemented basic server default comparison for the Oracle backend;
    previously, Oracle's formatting of reflected defaults prevented any
    matches from occurring.

    :tags: bug, sqlite

    the local metadata side.

.. change::
    :tags: bug, mssql

    and the local metadata side.

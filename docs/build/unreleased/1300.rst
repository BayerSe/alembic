    Added support for ``op.drop_constraint()`` to support PostrgreSQL
    ``ExcludeConstraint`` objects, as well as other constraint-like objects
    that may be present in third party dialects, by resolving the ``type_``
    parameter to be ``None`` for this case.   Autogenerate has also been
    enhanced to exclude the ``type_`` parameter from rendering within this
    command when  ``type_`` is ``None``.  Pull request courtesy David Hills.

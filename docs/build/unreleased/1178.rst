    :tickets: 1178

    Modified the autogenerate implementation for comparing "server default"
    values from user-defined metadata to not apply any quoting to the value
    before comparing it to the server-reported default, except for within
    dialect-specific routines as needed. This change will affect the format of
    the server default as passed to the
    :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.compare_server_default` hook, as
    well as for third party dialects that implement a custom
    ``compare_server_default`` hook in their alembic impl, to be passed "as is"
    and not including additional quoting.   Custom implementations which rely
    on this quoting should adjust their approach based on observed formatting.

    Fixed issue where indexes on SQLite which include SQL expressions would not
    compare against themselves correctly, generating false positives.
    SQLAlchemy as of version 2 has no support for reflecting expression based
    indexes on SQLite; so for now, the behavior is that SQLite expression-based
    indexes are ignored for autogenerate compare, in the same way that
    PostgreSQL expression-based indexes were ignored for the time that
    SQLAlchemy did not support reflection of such indexes (which is now
    supported in SQLAlchemy 2.0 as well as this release of Alembic).

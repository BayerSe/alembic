    :tickets: 1165

    Fixed issue where indexes on SQLite which include SQL expressions would not
    compare correctly, generating false positives under autogenerate. These
    indexes are now skipped, generating a warning, in the same way that
    expression-based indexes on PostgreSQL are skipped and generate warnings
    when SQLAlchemy 1.x installations are in use. Note that reflection of
    SQLite expression-based indexes continues to not yet be supported under
    SQLAlchemy 2.0, even though PostgreSQL expression-based indexes have now
    been implemented.

    The ``op.drop_table()`` operation directive will now trigger the
    ``before_drop()`` and ``after_drop()`` DDL event hooks at the table level,
    which is similar to how the ``before_create()`` and ``after_create()``
    hooks are triggered by the ``op.create_table()`` directive. Note that as
    ``op.drop_table()`` accepts only a table name and optional schema name, the
    ``Table`` object received by the event will not have any information within
    it other than the table name and schema name.

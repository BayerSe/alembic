    Fixed issue regarding PostgreSQL :class:`.ExcludeConstraint`, where
    constraint elements which made use of :func:`.literal_column` could not be
    rendered for autogenerate. Additionally, using SQLAlchemy 2.0.5 or greater,
    :func:`.text()` constructs are also supported within PostgreSQL
    :class:`.ExcludeConstraint` objects for autogenerate render. Pull request

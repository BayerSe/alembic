    Fixed typing issue where :paramref:`.revision.process_revision_directives`
    was not fully typed; additionally ensured all ``Callable`` and ``Dict``
    arguments to :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.configure` include parameters in
    the typing declaration.

    Additionally updated the codebase for Mypy 0.990 compliance.

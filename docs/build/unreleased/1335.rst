    Repaired :class:`.ExecuteSQLOp` so that it can participate in "diff"
    operations; while this object is typically not present in a reflected
    operation stream, custom hooks may be adding this construct where it needs
    to have the correct ``to_diff_tuple()`` method.  Pull request courtesy

    Updated stub generator script to also add stubs method definitions for the
    :class:`.Operations` class and the :class:`.BatchOperations` class obtained
    from :meth:`.Operations.batch_alter_table`. As part of this change, the
    class hierarchy of :class:`.Operations` and :class:`.BatchOperations` has
    been rearranged on top of a common base class :class:`.AbstractOperations`
    in order to type correctly, as :class:`.BatchOperations` uses different
    method signatures for operations than :class:`.Operations`.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, typing

    Repaired the return signatures for :class:`.Operations` that mostly
    return ``None``, and were erroneously referring to ``Optional[Table]``
    in many cases.

    Ongoing fixes for SQL Server server default comparisons under autogenerate,
    adjusting for SQL Server's collapsing of whitespace between SQL function
    arguments when reporting on a function-based server default, as well as its
    arbitrary addition of parenthesis within arguments; the approach has now
    been made more aggressive by stripping the two default strings to compare
    of all whitespace, parenthesis, and quoting characters.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, postgresql

    Fixed PostgreSQL server default comparison to handle SQL expressions
    sent as ``text()`` constructs, such as ``text("substring('name', 1, 3)")``,
    which previously would raise errors when attempting to run a server-based
    comparison.

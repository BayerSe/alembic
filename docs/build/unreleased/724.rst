    Added new Alembic command ``alembic check``. This performs the widely
    requested feature of running an "autogenerate" comparison between the
    current database and the :class:`.MetaData` that's currently set up for
    autogenerate, returning an error code if the two do not match, based on
    current autogenerate settings. Pull request courtesy Nathan Louie.

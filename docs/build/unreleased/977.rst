    Fixed bug where an :meth:`.Operations.alter_column` operation would change
    a "NOT NULL" column to "NULL" by emitting an ALTER COLUMN statement that
    did not specify "NOT NULL". (In the absence of "NOT NULL" T-SQL was
    implicitly assuming "NULL"). An :meth:`.Operations.alter_column` operation
    that specifies :paramref:`.Operations.alter_column.type` should also
    specify include either :paramref:`.Operations.alter_column.nullable` or
    :paramref:`.Operations.alter_column.existing_nullable` to inform Alembic as
    to whether the emitted DDL should include "NULL" or "NOT NULL"; a warning
    is now emitted if this is missing under this scenario.
